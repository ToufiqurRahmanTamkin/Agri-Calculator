Plowing and tilling of land is done to predetermined levels that allow rice plants to develop a good root system.\r\nThe proper preparation of land for sowing is achieved via tractors (mechanical means) or with the help of water buffaloes. Land preparation also includes land leveling to ensure water reaches all areas planted.\r\n3.Crop establishment\r\nTransplanting\r\nDirect seeding\r\n4.Water management\r\nProper creation and maintenance of field channels for water delivery\r\nLand levelling that allows water to be evenly distributed and retained\r\nTilling operations that include rice field bund preparation, water puddling and maintenance\r\n5.Nutrient management\r\nEach growth stage of the rice plant has a different nutrient need. Keeping this in mind, farmers must ensure that the rice plant gets the proper nutrients at the right time.\r\n6.Crop health management\r\nThe rice plant can come under threat from different sources in the field. These include attack by rodents, insects, weeds and disease. Farmers use many different strategies to protect and maintain crop health.\r\n7.Harvesting\r\nHarvesting is the process of collecting the mature rice crop (rice paddy or rough rice) from the field. Depending on the variety, a rice crop usually reaches maturity at around 115-120 days after crop establishment.\r\n8.Post harvest\r\nAfter harvest, the rice grain undergoes a number of processes depending on how it will be used. These steps include drying, storing, milling, and final processing.\r\n\r\nmanure in per hactare: \r\nN: 110\r\nP2O5: 34\r\nK2O: 156\r\nMgo: 23\r\nCaO: 20\r\nS:5\r\nFe: 2\r\nMn: 2\r\nZn:0.2\r\nCu:0.15\r\nB:0.15\r\nsi:0.25\r\nCL:0.025',348),(2,'Banana','Prepare the soil for your banana plant by turning it over and blending it with 50 percent new topsoil using your shovel and pitchfork.\r\nBlend in 1/2 pound of compost and organic fertilizers to create soil that is high in nutrients and nicely aerated. Prepare a patch of\r\nsoil about 4 feet across and about 3 feet in depth.\r\nPlant your bananas in the early summer months to ensure the high 70s and low 80s temperatures required for the new plant to take root.\r\nThis will also provide several months of temperatures in the 80s and above for the fruit to form and ripen. Once the seasons change and\r\nthe temps fall, the banana plant will retract until the warm weather comes around again.\r\nCut a rhizome from an existing banana tree or plant for use as a seedling. Rhizomes are sucker shoots that form either just above or just\r\nbelow ground at the base of the tree or plant. These suckers are offshoots that form roots quickly, so they are ideal transplant material.\r\nUse a sharp shovel edge or blade to remove the rhizome, and place it into your freshly turned soil for planting.\r\nPlant each rhizome about nine feet apart to allow enough room for growth and development but not so much that trees end up fending for\r\nthemselves with no support from other trees. Banana trees require shelter from wind and weather, and other banana trees provide such shelter.\r\nCreate humidity for your banana plants by spraying them from the top down and ensuring that the leaves are wet several times each day.\r\nSince the plants are native to rain forest and subtropical climates, these same conditions should be mimicked for the best results.\r\nRepeat this irrigation schedule daily.\r\nRemove weeds by hand whenever they become visible. Spread a layer of mulch around the base of the plant to prevent weeds from growing\r\nand to help with water drainage while preventing rot. Place 1 to 2 pounds of organic fertilizer around the base of your banana plants\r\nevery month to keep the nutrient levels up where they need to be for successful fruit production.\r\nPick your bananas in late summer and again in early spring. Use a sharp blade to remove only the bunches that are turning yellow, while\r\nleaving the rest to ripen further.\r\nManure:\r\nN: 320\r\np2o5:60\r\nK2o:1000',1380),(3,'Pomelo','Pomelo trees can be grown from seed, but bring your patience as the tree will likely not fruit for at least eight years.\r\nThey can be air layered or grafted onto existing citrus rootstock as well. As with all citrus trees, pummelo trees enjoy\r\nfull sun especially hot, rainy climates. Additional pomelo tree care requires not only full sun exposure, but also moist soil.\r\nGrowing pomelo trees are not picky regarding their soil and will thrive equally in clay, loam or sand with a highly acidic and\r\nhighly alkaline pH. Regardless of the soil type, provide the pomelo with good drainage and water at least once a week. Keep the\r\narea around your pomelo free from debris, grass, and weeds to retard disease and fungus. Fertilize with a citrus fertilizer\r\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pomelo trees grow 24 inches (61 cm.) per season and can live from 50-150 years\r\nand reach a height of 25 feet (7.6 m.).\r\nManure:\r\nN: 290\r\np2o5:110\r\nK2o:230',630),(4,'Citrus','Citrus trees should be planted in a sunny and wind-protected area.In the citrus\r\nbelt (a loosely defined area stretching from southern California to Florida), \r\ntrees can be planted at any time, however,spring is the best time for container-grown plants.\r\nStandard-size citrus trees should be spaced 12 to 25 feet apart and dwarf citrus\r\ntrees should be set 6 to 10 feet apart. The exact distance depends on the variety. \r\nThe bigger the fruit, the farther the distance.If the soil is not well-drained, plant \r\nthe trees on a slight mound to prevent waterlogging.\r\nTo plant citrus trees inside from seeds, remove the seeds from the desired fruit.\r\nSoak the seeds overnight in water and plant them ½ inch deep in moist potting soil.\r\nCover the pot with a plastic bag or wrap and let it sit in a warm and sunny spot for\r\na few weeks until the seeds start to grow. Then, remove the plastic but keep the pot\r\nnear a warm and sunny window.\r\nManure:\r\nN: 270\r\np2o5:60\r\nK2o:350',680),(5,'Avocado','Avocado roots need plenty of air, so avoid overwatering. Always let container\r\nsoil dry out slightly, then water thoroughly to moisten the entire root ball.\r\nIf your container tree moves outdoors for summer, it may need daily watering.\r\nContainer plants dry out more quickly in sun and wind — and don\'t forget to bring\r\nyour plant indoors once temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit in fall.\r\nFor landscape avocados, water the entire area beneath the tree\'s canopy. Water\r\ndeeply and thoroughly, then allow the soil to dry out slightly before you water again.\r\nMost avocado roots stay in the top six inches of soil, which can dry out quickly.\r\nNewly planted trees may need water two to three times per week their first year. \r\nMature avocado trees need water equal to about 2 inches of rainfall or irrigation each week during summer.1\r\nFertilizing - Avocados do best with plant foods designed specifically for avocados \r\nand citrus. They prefer fertilizers with higher amounts of nitrogen relative to phosphorus \r\nand potassium. That means that the first number in the N-P-K ratio on your fertilizer label \r\nshould be higher than the other two.\r\nPennington UltraGreen Citrus & Avocado Plant Food 10-5-5 provides avocados with an ideal \r\nblend of primary nutrients plus added micronutrients, including zinc and iron, which are \r\nespecially important to avocado health and growth. This premium fertilizer starts feeding\r\nimmediately, then continues feeding your tree for up to four months.\r\nFeed container avocados every 12 to 16 weeks, according to label rates based on the container\r\nsize. For outdoor landscape avocados, feed in late winter, midsummer and again in early fall,\r\naccording to the recommended label rate based on the tree\'s age.\r\nManure:\r\nN: 250\r\nP:40\r\np2o5:90\r\nK:290\r\nK2O:350',1020),(6,'Apple','Before planting, remove all weeds and the grass in a 4-foot diameter circle. \r\nAfter you purchase the tree, protect it from injury, drying out, freezing, or overheating. If the roots have dried out, soak them in water about 24 hours before planting.\r\nTree spacing is influenced by the rootstock, soil fertility, and pruning. Seedlings or full-size trees should be planted about 15 to 18 feet apart in a row. A dwarfing rootstock might be 4 to 8 feet apart in a row. Of course, apple trees require cross-pollination; a different cultivar that blooms at the same time must be planted within 2,000 feet (preferably, nearer).\r\nDig a hole approximately twice the diameter of the root system and 2 feet deep. Place some of the loose soil back into the hole and loosen the soil on the walls of the planting hole so the roots can easily penetrate the soil. Spread the tree roots on the loose soil, making sure they are not twisted or crowded in the hole. Continue to replace soil around the roots. As you begin to cover the roots, firm the soil to be sure it surrounds the roots and to remove air pockets.\r\nDo not add fertilizer at planting time, as the roots can be “burned”. Fill the remainder of the hole with the loose soil, and press the soil down well.\r\nMost apple trees are grafted. The graft union must be at least 2 inches above the soil line so that roots do not emerge from the scion. The graft union (where the scion is attached to the rootstock) can be recognized by the swelling at the junction. \r\nDwarf apple trees are notoriously prone to uprooting under the weight of a heavy crop, so you should provide a support system for your hedge. You can grow your trees against a fence, or you can provide free-standing support in the form of a trellis.\r\nWater young trees regularly, especially those on semidwarfing or dwarfing rootstocks, to ensure that the root system becomes well established.\r\nRenew mulch periodically, but pull it away from the tree in the fall so mice don’t nest over the winter and eat the bark.\r\nApple trees require initial training to nurture a strong frame of branches so the trees can carry heavy apple crops. Dwarf plants must be supported with posts or trellis and trained to a central leader system. Standard (and sem-dwarf) trees should also be trained to a modified leader.\r\nPest control measures will be an important part of care. Correct timing is critical to avoid harming the bees and pollination. When used, pesticides are applied at a specific stage of flower and fruit development, not according to a calendar. It’s important to research your variety and climate to know which pests are most likely to be a problem to apply the right controls at the right time.\r\nIf you wish to avoid pesticides, it’s possible though apple trees are the one of the most pest-susceptible fruits. For example, you can place paper bags around each apple of your tree, though this takes some time and labor. There are also organic pesticides.\r\nManure:\r\nN: 100\r\np2o5:45\r\nK2o:180',325),(7,'Sunflower','It’s best to sow sunflower seeds directly into the soil after the danger of spring frost has passed. Ideally, the soil temperature has reached 55 to 60 degrees F (13–16°C).\r\nGive plants plenty of room, especially for low-growing varieties that will branch out. Make rows about 30 inches apart. (For very small varieties, plant closer together.)\r\nPlant the large seeds no more than 1 inch deep about 6 inches apart after the soil has thoroughly warmed, from mid-April to late May in northern regions—earlier in southern areas. You can plant multiple seeds and thin them to the strongest contenders when the plants are six inches tall.\r\nA light application of fertilizer mixed in at planting time will encourage strong root growth to protect them from blowing over in the wind.\r\nExperiment with plantings staggered over 5 to 6 weeks to keep enjoying continuous blooms.\r\nIf you see birds scratching around for the seeds, spread netting over the planted area until seeds germinate. See more ways to keep birds away from your garden.\r\nWhile the plant is small, water around the root zone, about 3 to 4 in. from the plant. To protect the plant, it may help to put snail or slug bait around the stem.\r\nOnce the plant is established, water deeply though infrequently to encourage deep rooting. Unless the weather is exceptionally wet or dry, water once a week with several gallons of water.\r\nFeed plants only sparingly; overfertilization can cause stems to break in the fall. You can add diluted fertilizer into the water, though avoid getting the fertilizer near the plant’s base; it may help to build a moat in a circle around the plant about 18 inches out.\r\nTall species and cultivars require support. Bamboo stakes are a good choice for any plant that has a strong, single stem and needs support for a short period of time.\r\nManure:\r\nN: 120\r\np2o5:60\r\nK2o:240',420),(8,'Peanuts','Peanuts have a long growing season (ranging from 100 to 130 frost-free days); they’re planted a few weeks after the average last frost date in the spring and often dug up anytime after the first of September.\r\nThe trick to raising them in the North is to choose an early-maturing variety such as “Early Spanish” (100 days) and plant on a south-facing slope, if possible. You could also get a head start to the season by sowing peanuts indoors 5 to 8 weeks before transplanting outside.\r\nIt’s important to select a site that receives full sun.\r\nPlastic row covers are recommended to protect the young plants from spring frosts.\r\nTo grow peanuts, you will actually need to start with fresh, raw, uncooked peanuts still in their shells.\r\nTo start inside, fill a large, four-inch-deep plastic bowl ⅔ full of moist potting soil. Shell four peanuts and place them on top of the soil; then cover with one inch of soil. Plants will sprout quickly. Transplant seedlings outside after the threat of frost has passed.\r\nTo plant outside, place the peanut seeds two inches deep and eight inches apart in loose, well-drained soil. (Add sand and aged compost to soil to loosen.)\r\nWhen the plants are six inches high, cultivate around them to loosen the soil so that the pegs will penetrate it easily.\r\nThen, hill them as you would potatoes and mulch with two inches of straw or grass clippings.\r\nSmall, yellow, pea-like flowers will develop along the lower part of the stem. After the flowers fade, the ovaries will swell, start to grow toward the ground, and then push into the soil.\r\nPeanuts are harvested before frost, when the plant yellows.\r\nDig out the entire plant with a spading fork, carefully shake off most of the soil, and then hang to dry indoors for about a month.\r\nThe “nut” can be enjoyed raw or roasted to perfection by baking shelled or unshelled in a 350°F oven for 20 minutes.\r\nManure:\r\nN: 170\r\np2o5:30\r\nK2o:110',310),(9,'Tomato','Apply 2 to 3 pounds of a complete fertilizer such as 5-10-5, 10-10-10, or 6-10-4 per 100 square feet of garden area. Do not apply high nitrogen fertilizers such as those recommended for lawns.\r\nExcessive nitrogen will promote luxurious foliage but will delay flowering and fruiting. \r\nSpace tomato transplants 2 feet apart for small bush-type plants or larger plants that will be staked. Space larger plants 3 to 4 feet apart if unstaked. Allow 4 feet between the rows. \r\nPinch off a few of the lower branches on transplants, and plant the root ball deep enough so that the remaining lowest leaves are just above the surface of the soil. \r\nIf your transplants are leggy, you can remedy this by burying up to ⅔ of the plant, including the lower sets of leaves. Tomato stems have the ability to grow roots from the buried stems.\r\nBe sure to water the transplant thoroughly to establish good root/soil contact and prevent wilting.\r\nNewly set transplants may need to be shaded for the first week or so to prevent excessive drying of the leaves. \r\nWater generously the first few days that the tomato seedlings or transplants are in the ground.\r\nWater well throughout the growing season, about 2 inches per week during the summer. Water deeply for a strong root system.\r\nWater in the early morning. This gives plant the moisture it needs to make it through a hot day. Avoid watering late afternoon or evening. \r\nMulch five weeks after transplanting to retain moisture and to control weeds. Mulch also keeps soil from splashing the lower tomato leaves. Apply 2 to 4 inches of organic mulch such as straw, hay, or bark chips after the soil has had a chance to warm up.\r\nTo help tomatoes through periods of drought, find some flat rocks and place one next to each plant. The rocks prevent water from evaporating from the soil.\r\n\r\nManure:\r\nN: 140\r\np2o5:65\r\nK2o:190',395),(10,'Potatoes','Dust the seed potatoes with agricultural sulfur by putting a handful of sulfur in a paper bag, adding the potatoes and shaking them around. This protects against fungal diseases. Dig holes 3\" to 4\" deep in hills 12\" apart. Place the seed potatoes in the holes cut side down with the eyes pointing up. Cover the seed potatoes with of soil. Water well.\r\nAbout five weeks after planting, the potatoes should be \"hilled.\" To hill potatoes, simply pile soil up around the stems. This forces new potatoes to grow above the seed potatoes planted earlier. When hilling, it is okay to leave a few of the upper leaves exposed or cover the entire plant. Hill frequently enough so that new tubers are never exposed to direct sun.\r\nOn average, potatoes mature in about 70 or 100-plus days. One clue that the potatoes are almost ready to harvest is that the leaves will yellow and the foliage will die back. It’s best to leave them in the ground for two or three weeks after this point so that their skins toughen up. Use a pitch fork and your hands to carefully dig them up.\r\nManure:\r\nN: 175\r\np2o5:80\r\nK2o:310',565);
