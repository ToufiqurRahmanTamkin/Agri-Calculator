<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	Bangladesh is the leading agricultural country. Eighty percent of the people are directly or indirectly involved in farming. The total cultivable land of this country is 85.77 lakh hectares. Agriculture contributes 21.91% to the economy of Bangladesh. With the improvement of science, there has been an unprecedented change in agriculture. With improved farming practices, agricultural research centers as well as improved seeds, adequate fertilizers and pesticides, irrigation systems have opened up new horizons in agriculture.
	The spatial and temporal management of the crop during different cultivation seasons of the year is dependent on the type of soil, the characteristics of the soil and the availability of water. There is not a lot of irrigation system in Bangladesh's land. That's why a lot of rain has to be dependent. Again, the system is also inadequate for drainage during heavy rains. For this reason, scientific equipment must be used properly. We have to dig wells to irrigate the land. Water drainage should be provided. For the right land, the right season to distinguish the crop should be selected. Regular weed suppression, fertilizer should be done properly.
	Pesticides should be used to protect the crop from pests. If the crop is mature, it is best to harvest it. Farming has accelerated due to the availability of low-cost crops through scientific instruments. Depending on the type of land, soil texture, flooding, rainfall (quantity and distribution) and the production environment of the crops affected by the assistance of the farmer, there are usually many cropping patterns in Bangladesh.

	Bangladesh is a farming area but there are many people who want to carry them in agriculture. But there is no app that advises people who are in their carrier. Many people want to produce different kinds of things but they do not get any suggestions for this so we will create an app that will be more helpful to these people.
	We are going to make this project so that we can help those who are trying to carry them in agriculture. We will provide all agricultural advice that will be helpful to their carrier.
